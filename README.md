# OpenWrt package for Ookla Speedtest CLI

This repository provides an unofficial, source-only OpenWrt package recipe for
the [Ookla Speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli). It does not
contain or distribute Ookla binaries, release archives, or prebuilt OpenWrt
`.ipk` or `.apk` packages.

## Supported targets

The recipe supports Ookla's Linux ARM releases for:

- 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`)
- 32-bit ARM with the hard-float ABI (`armhf`)
- 32-bit ARM with the soft-float ABI (`armel`)

Other architectures are not selectable for this package.

## Install from the signed feed

On an OpenWrt router whose `opkg print-architecture` output includes
`aarch64_cortex-a53`, install the prebuilt IPK from the project-maintained
signed feed:

```sh
wget -qO- https://keithah.github.io/openwrt-packages/install-ookla-speedtest-cli.sh | sh
```

The installer adds the feed's public key without disabling opkg signature
verification, configures the `keithah` feed, updates its package lists, and
installs only `ookla-speedtest-cli`. The published feed currently supports
only `aarch64_cortex-a53`; use the source-build instructions below for the
other supported ARM targets and for OpenWrt releases that use APK packages.

The installer does not accept Ookla's license agreement. The first
`speedtest` run asks you to review and accept the Ookla EULA and privacy
policy.

## Build and install

From the root of an OpenWrt source tree on the build host, clone the package,
select **Utilities → ookla-speedtest-cli** in the configuration menu, and
build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keithah/openwrt-ookla-speedtest-cli.git \
  package/openwrt-ookla-speedtest-cli
make menuconfig
make package/ookla-speedtest-cli/compile V=s
```

The OpenWrt build downloads the matching vendor archive and verifies it
against the architecture-specific SHA-256 checksum pinned in the recipe.

The output package format and package manager depend on the OpenWrt version:

- OpenWrt 24.10 and older produce an `.ipk`, installed with `opkg`.
- OpenWrt 25.12 and newer produce an `.apk`, installed with `apk`.

See OpenWrt's [package-management overview](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/managing_packages)
and [APK documentation](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/apk)
for the official version-specific guidance.

Copy the generated `.ipk` or `.apk` from the build host's `bin/packages/`
tree to `/tmp` on the OpenWrt router. The `/tmp` paths in the commands below
refer to the router's filesystem, not the build host's.

On an OpenWrt 24.10 or older router, install the `.ipk`:

```bash
opkg install /tmp/ookla-speedtest-cli_*.ipk
```

On an OpenWrt 25.12 or newer router, install the locally built, unsigned
`.apk` with the required `--allow-untrusted` option:

```bash
apk add --allow-untrusted /tmp/ookla-speedtest-cli-*.apk
```

Then run `speedtest` on the router:

```bash
speedtest
```

On first use, `speedtest` asks you to accept Ookla's license agreement and
privacy policy. Review the [Ookla EULA](https://www.speedtest.net/about/eula)
before accepting it.

## Updates

A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow checks Ookla's official CLI page daily for
a complete newer ARM release. It downloads the three supported archives in
temporary runner storage, validates their archive and ELF architecture, and
changes `PKG_VERSION`, resets `PKG_RELEASE` to `1`, and replaces all three
architecture-specific checksums in the recipe.
After the test suite passes, the workflow commits that text-only recipe update
directly to `main`. It never commits or publishes the vendor archives,
executables, or generated `.ipk` or `.apk` files.
